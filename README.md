# RISK Roller

RISK Roller is an automated dice roller for the board game RISK. Simply select the number of attackers and defenders, then click the button to roll the dice.

This app will automatically calculate the results of the dice rolls and display the winner, the number of attackers and defenders remaining, and a summary of the dice rolls.

This app always rolls the maximum number of dice possible for each player. For example, if the attacker has 4 armies, they will roll 3 dice. If the defender has 2 armies, they will roll 2 dice.

Beware! This app always rolls to completion. Either the attacker or defender will be victorious!
